MateMac needs to be on a web hosting.

How to use it ?

Put the folder "MateMacGlob" in the ftp of you web hosting.
Now go to www.yoururl.com/MateMacGlob/MateMac/?steamid=%s,
If you get your loader, it's installed.

BUT you need to configure it. So go to MateMacGlob/MateMac/index.php,
open it with for example sublime text and start editing the code.


//CHANGE BACKGROUND//
Replace the file demo_background.jpg in MateMacGlob/MateMac/assets/
by your image. Then change the url in MateMacGlob/MateMac/index.php by your image name and extension.

EXAMPLE:

I put lol.png in assets, it's my background. 
So now I got in MateMacGlob/MateMac/index.php and I change



    <img src="assets/demo_background.jpg"><!--Change your background url here (image located in assets folder)-->
    BY
    <img src="assets/lol.png"><!--Change your background url here (image located in assets folder)-->





//CHANGE ADDONS CATEGORY IN INFOS TAB//
Just replace "Addons" in MateMacGlob/MateMac/index.php by what you want.

EXAMPLE:

I want to change "Addons" by "car dealer",
So now I got in MateMacGlob/MateMac/index.php and I change



    <li><img src="assets/extensions.png"> <span>Addons</span></li>
    BY
    <li><img src="assets/extensions.png"> <span>car dealer</span></li>





//CHANGE RULES//
Replace the rules in MateMacGlob/MateMac/index.php  by yours.






//CHANGE SONG
Replace the file song.ogg in MateMacGlob/MateMac/songs/
by your ogg file. Then change the url in MateMacGlob/MateMac/index.php by your file name.

EXAMPLE:

I put fun.mp3 in songs, it's my song. 
So now I got in MateMacGlob/MateMac/index.php and I change



    <audio class='audio' autoplay ><!--Song is in the folder songs-->
    <source type='audio/ogg' src='songs/song.ogg'>
    </audio>
    BY
    <audio class='audio' autoplay ><!--Song is in the folder songs-->
    <source type='audio/ogg' src='songs/fun.ogg'>
    </audio>


PS:SONG IN OGG

Thanks you
